# Leveler Pro 
a very exaggerated name for a simple app that took me a few hours to make.
I was thinking of renaming it Leveler Pro 3000 Ultimate Edition what do you think?

This Maui app demonstrates how to animate data from a sensor in a Maui app. 
This example shows how to use the accelerometer sensor to create a Leveler
app 

The App also detects when the phone orientation changes and displays 2 different UI depending on the orientation.

In Landscape mode it animates a bubble to indicate the flatness of the surface the device lays on. 

In Portrait mode it will change to display a plumb aligner to check if the device is vertically aligned.

## This app uses no external libraries, only the Maui API.
